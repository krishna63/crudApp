# Crud Application(Create, Read, Update, Delete)
I am learning from scratch how to build an application with react using crud , routing and environment set up

I am going to add my TOdO for joining into IBM

TODO:
I should be familiar with github

Learnt on 09/sep
I have learnt to fork the project
I have learnt to clone the project using command git clone <url>
Next i have to create a branch using the command.
    git checkout -b <branchname> <copyfrom the branch>
    ex: git checkout -b addingPause  master
List of commands available in git link: https://git-scm.com/doc

Commands:-------------------------------------------
git clone <url> ---> for cloning to the local directory
git checout -b addingPauseReq master ----> creating a branch in my repository
git status --->>> to see the added and updated files info
git add . / git add Readme ---> trying to add a file or code or folder 
git commit -m "message"   ----->>> commiting 
git push origin addingPauseReq     ---->>> It will push the code tp branch addingPauseReq
git reset --hard  ---->>> will save the previous files.
git status
git add <filename>

#### Command to add a remote branch:
<p>Below command helps to add a remote branch to your local system:</p>
  <code>git remote add <nameof the master repo> <url of the master repo></code><br>
  <code>Eg: git remote add upstream https://github.com/krishna63/crudApp.git<code>

#### Command to fetch the latest code:
<p>Next you need to run the below command:</p>
  <code>git pull <name of the master repo> <name of the branch></code><br>
  <code>Eg: git pull upstream master</code>

<p>Note: <strong>We need to run  the above command at regular intervals so that we always have the latest code in the master.</strong></p>

<u>Task</u>:
<ol>
  <li> Create a new branch called notesAboutNPM</li>
  <li> Add a new file and name it NOTES_README.md file</li>
  <li> Start following the same practise for each of the tools/process we learn during our training activity.</li>
</ol>
