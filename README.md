# crudApp
I am learning from scratch how to build an application with react using crud , routing and environment set up


I am going to add my TOdO for joining into IBM

TODO:

Learnt on 09/sep
I have learnt to fork the project
I have learnt to clone the project using command git clone <url>
Next i have to create a branch using the command.
    git checkout -b <branchname> <copyfrom the branch>
    ex: git checkout -b addingPause  master
List of commands available in git link: https://git-scm.com/doc

Commands:-------------------------------------------
git clone <url> ---> for cloning to the local directory
git checkout -b addingPauseReq master ----> creating a branch in my repository and it is taking `master` as a reference to create a branch
git status --->>> to see the added and updated files info
git add . / git add Readme ---> trying to add a file or code or folder 
git commit -m "message"   ----->>> commiting 
git push origin addingPauseReq     ---->>> It will push the code tp branch addingPauseReq
git reset --hard  ---->>> will save the previous files.
git status
git add <filename>
